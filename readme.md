# GoogleClone
Hi make Clone is the best way to improve your skill set and create better ways of creating things and new ways of solving real problems.

First, analyze the web application and create a path to create it.

I divided it into three parts Nav, Main, and Footer.

Use Flexbox in Nav and Main, in Footer use Grid Layout to position it.

The whole project was created following good practices, both responsive practices and readable code practices.
